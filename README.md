In this portfolio, you will find a showcase of my data science projects and the skills I have acquired
### Build web app for presenting my projects
let's try on this link
[Streamlit Webapp](https://natapollim-streamlit-portfolio-0-profile-ayvdum.streamlit.app)

## Face Blur Image
Goal of this project is learn to use MTCNN algorothm and Streamlit framework

![Demo Face Blur app](./assets/profile/demo_face_blur.GIF)

This app used to Blur wanted faces which are detected from Face Detection model.

Have **3** main steps

**Step1:** Upload an image or try with an example image

**Step2:** Processing and select wanted faces

**Step3:** Then hit summit button for blur process and click 'Download' for download
## Face Recognition
**Goal:** design basic features of face recognition system and learn to preprocess image and use deep learning model

This app have **3** features
- Check-In
- Face in Database
- Add Face
        
**Check-In:** Mock situation of already have your own face in the Database and would like to check attendance

**Face in Database:** Show all faces that in Database now

**Add Face:** Add new face in to Database
  
### Example cases
      
**Example1:** you can try an example Elon or Code image which already have different face in Database

**Example2:** you can upload your image in to Add Face page and fill the name then click 'Add face'.
        After you have added new face, you can check by upload a new image with the same person on Check-In page and click 'Process' to see the result

**Example3:** Use your webcam camera to Add Face or Check-In
